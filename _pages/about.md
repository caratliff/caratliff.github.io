Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm currently a second year graduate student at Duke University pursuing a Masters in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS). I've created this platform for sharing knowledge and projects as I journey through my graduate program. 

When I'm not in the classroom or studying, I spend time training for endurance races (ex. cycling, marathon, triathlon) as a member of Duke's Triathlon Club Team. One of my many goals for 2023 is to complete [Ironman Tulsa](https://www.ironman.com/im-tulsa) to become an IRONMAN.
