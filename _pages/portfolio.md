## Capstone
* Arria Boost: Sports Analytics Data Storytelling ([report](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/rmratliffbrown.github.io/blob/06cf0045e0f8cf20318625bee3daecfe289750d0/files/boost_report.pdf))
  * Engineered a probabilistic machine learning model for NCAA Division I soccer team rankings, achieving predictive accuracy for match outcomes above the professional soccer baseline by 5%.
  * Enhanced model performance over sequential seasons, validating the model's capability to adapt and improve through continuous learning.
  * Designed a dynamic, user-interactive dashboard providing real-time, in-game feature-based analytics, enabling users to make informed decisions with a holistic view of team performance.
  * Successfully incorporated direct modeling of match draws and tournament projections, demonstrating a strong correlation with expert rankings and achieving an 83.3% accuracy rate in men's team field predictions.
  * Constructed a unique adjusted margin of victory metric, contributing to a system that outperforms the FIFA ranking system in predictive accuracy and score predictions.
  * Feature Engineering, Statistical Machine Learning Modeling, Data Visualization and Pipeline Automation. 

## Statistical Modeling
* StockX Sneaker Analysis ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/stockx-sneaker-stats) // [report](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/stockx-sneaker-stats/blob/main/final-report.pdf))
  * Utilized sneaker data from the 2019 StockX Data Contest to regress "hype value" (difference between retail value and resale value) on sneaker characteristics like color, brand, type, etc. to draw conclusions on which variables play a signficant role in determining the total resale value.
  * Implemented a multiple linear regression model using R scripting after handling outliers. 
* Job Training on Wages Analysis ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/job-training-wages))
  * Used R scripts to construct a logistic regression to determine whether or not an employee who received job training tends to be more likely to receive positive wages than employees that did not receive job training

## Cloud Data Engineering
* Strava Microservice - Continuous Delivery of FastAPI Data Engineering API on AWS ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/data-engineering-strava-api) // [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedq9HfGd0A)) 
  * Developed a Microservice that returns a JSON payload to be utilized for performance data visualizations 
  * Pushed tested source code to Github and performed Continuous Integration with Github Actions
  * Configured Build Server to Deploy Changes on build (Continuous Delivery)

* Strava CLI ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/strava-cli) // [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmJdEXsEwak))
  * Utilized Click to create a Command Line Interface(CLI) tool in Python that gathers information about a Strava athleteâ€™s activities

* Marathon Finish Predictor ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-marathon-finish-predictor))
  * A microservice using Machine Learning and Flask to predict marathon finish time

* Stroke Predictor Microservice ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-stroke-predictor) // [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9bSNdFvXZ4))
  * Developed an application that uses Docker, Flask, and sklearn predict the likelihood of someone to have a stroke
 
* Product Recommendation Engine ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/Recommend))

## Unifying Data Science/Causal Inference
* The Legacy of the Taliban on Female Education in Pakistan ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/uds-2022-ids-701-team-3) // [research paper](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/uds-2022-ids-701-team-3/blob/main/40-docs/IDS-701_Final_Project_Report.pdf) // [presentation](https://youtu.be/eLjWIdr0psk))

## Machine Learning
* Model-Based Approach to Music Genre Assignment ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-genre-assignment) // [research paper](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-genre-assignment/blob/main/30_docs/final-report.pdf) // [presentation](https://youtu.be/6-7XFk4KC9M)) 
  * Utilized Spotify API to obtain audio data to implement Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning models for improved genre assignment.

## Mobile Application Development
* Mobile Passport ([presentation](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/mobile-passport/blob/main/Mobile%20Passport.pdf))
  * Developed a mobile application that allows visitors of NC state parks to log visits and gain quick access to park information. 

## Duke Data Plus
* Plus Explorations Project ([read more](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/plus-programs-data-exploration/))
  * Collaborated with a team to consolidate historical data of Plus Programs, enhancing data-driven decision-making processes.
  * Analyzed longitudinal data spanning 8 years from multiple Plus Programs, including Data+, Code+, and CS+, to derive actionable insights on student engagement and program efficacy.
  * Spearheaded the development of a unified data structure, optimizing data storage and retrieval for robust reporting capabilities.
  * Designed and implemented a comprehensive dashboard to visualize participant data, facilitating the evaluation of program impact and strategic planning.
  * Enhanced text analysis capabilities by deploying advanced machine learning algorithms from the Hugging Face library, achieving nuanced insights from user-uploaded content.
  * Proposed data-informed recommendations to refine program offerings, which served as a basis for initiating targeted alumni outreach programs and improving student retention strategies.

## Algorithmic Trading - Financial Data and Modeling
* Powerful Pairs Trading ([report](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/rmratliffbrown.github.io/blob/038f33bf9a0e87274aaf348aa47e6ad13e43c96c/files/Final%20Algo%20Paper.pdf))
