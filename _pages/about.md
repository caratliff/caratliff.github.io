Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm currently a second year graduate student at Duke University pursuing a Masters in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS). I've created this platform for sharing knowledge and projects as I journey through my graduate program. 

When I'm not in the classroom or studying, I spend time training for endurance races (ex. cycling, marathon, triathlon) as a member of Duke's Triathlon Club Team. On May 21, 2023, I achieved one of my goals for the year, which was to complete [Ironman Tulsa](https://www.ironman.com/im-tulsa) and become an IRONMAN. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktQtcAhxv3E) capturing the moment that forever changed my life.
