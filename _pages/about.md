Welcome to my personal website! I am a proud alumnus of Duke University, where I completed my Masters in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS). This website is a culmination of my passion for data science and a reflection of my academic journey. During my time at Duke, I engaged in a variety of projects and research that explored the vast possibilities within the field of data science. From innovative analytics to complex problem-solving, each project enhanced my understanding and skills. Through this platform, I aim to share insights, learnings, and detailed accounts of my projects. My goal is to not only document my progress but also to provide a resource for fellow data science enthusiasts, students, and professionals. Join me as I delve into the intricacies of data science, sharing both my successes and challenges, and contributing to the ever-evolving world of technology and analysis.
