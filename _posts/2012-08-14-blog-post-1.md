The last couple months have been a period of transition and as I reflect back, I am overcome with gratitude for the people who supported me through the last two years of mental and physical challenges.

Last month I graduated from Duke University with a Master’s in Interdisciplinary Data Science. I am both grateful for the skills and knowledge I gained and for the incredible faculty and cohort that made it possible. I feel well prepared for a challenging and exciting career ahead.

I found balance and stress relief during the rigor of my program through endurance training. Despite my weakness as a swimmer and negative buoyancy, I joined Duke University’s Triathlon Club. This team of athletes not only kept me company during long training sessions but encouraged me to push my physical limits and grow into a more well-rounded athlete. Having that outlet and supportive community inspired me to take on the challenge of an Ironman distance triathlon, consisting of a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and 26.2 mile run with only six short months of training while still in the final year of my program.  A week after graduation, I successfully completed my first full Ironman.

The power of community allowed me to realize my potential and accomplish goals I once felt were far beyond my reach. I am empowered with a new sense of confidence after successfully completing such a mentally and physically rigorous period of my life. I have proven to myself the value of discipline, hard work, determination, and perseverance. With that said, a special thanks to all my peers, teammates, professors, and mentors for all their support.
