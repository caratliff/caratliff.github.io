I am currently a first year graduate student pursuing a Masters in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University. My technical background has shaped my programming, problem solving, and collaborative skills.

My passion for Computer Science and Mathematics stems from my hobbies. My curiosity about how and why technology works has flourished with time, study, and exploration.

Fueled by my passion for the field and utilizing technology to creatively solve problems, I am adamant about further developing my skills through future projects and endeavours in web design, data science, and progamming. In my spare time I enjoy gaming, piloting drones,learning about new technologies, and training for various race distances and triathlons.
