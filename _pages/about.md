Welcome to my personal portfolio webpage. I'm currently a first year graduate student at Duke University pursuing a Masters in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS). I've created this platform for sharing knowledge and projects as I journey through my graduate program. 

When I'm not in the classroom or studying, I spend time training for endurance races (ex. marathons, triathlons) and tinkering with my motorcycle. I'm very passionate about automobiles and motorcycles, so I typically attend car shows and partake in group motorcycle rides on the weekends. My motorcycle started as a commuter tool, but I quickly outgrew the factory 125cc engine and decided to replace it with a 300cc engine from a 2016 Honda CB300R. It has been an absolute blast and I cannot keep my hands off it since the swap.
