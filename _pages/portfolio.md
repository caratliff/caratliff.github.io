## Capstone
* Arria Boost: Sports Analytics Data Storytelling [report](#)
  * Built a robust machine learning model to rank and predict the performance of NCAA Division I soccer teams (men and women).
  * Developed an interactive dashboard that serves as a tool for end-users to receive stats and narratives for well-informed sports decisions.

## Statistical Modeling
* StockX Sneaker Analysis ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/stockx-sneaker-stats) // [report](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/stockx-sneaker-stats/blob/main/final-report.pdf))
  * Utilized sneaker data from the 2019 StockX Data Contest to regress "hype value" (difference between retail value and resale value) on sneaker characteristics like color, brand, type, etc. to draw conclusions on which variables play a signficant role in determining the total resale value.
  * Implemented a multiple linear regression model using R scripting after handling outliers. 
* Job Training on Wages Analysis ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/job-training-wages))
  * Used R scripts to construct a logistic regression to determine whether or not an employee who received job training tends to be more likely to receive positive wages than employees that did not receive job training

## Cloud Data Engineering
* Strava Microservice - Continuous Delivery of FastAPI Data Engineering API on AWS ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/data-engineering-strava-api) // [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedq9HfGd0A)) 
  * Developed a Microservice that returns a JSON payload to be utilized for performance data visualizations 
  * Pushed tested source code to Github and performed Continuous Integration with Github Actions
  * Configured Build Server to Deploy Changes on build (Continuous Delivery)

* Strava CLI ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/strava-cli) // [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmJdEXsEwak))
  * Utilized Click to create a Command Line Interface(CLI) tool in Python that gathers information about a Strava athleteâ€™s activities

* Marathon Finish Predictor ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-marathon-finish-predictor))
  * A microservice using Machine Learning and Flask to predict marathon finish time

* Stroke Predictor Microservice ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-stroke-predictor) // [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9bSNdFvXZ4))
  * Developed an application that uses Docker, Flask, and sklearn predict the likelihood of someone to have a stroke
 
* Product Recommendation Engine ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/Recommend))

## Unifying Data Science/Causal Inference
* The Legacy of the Taliban on Female Education in Pakistan ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/uds-2022-ids-701-team-3) // [research paper](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/uds-2022-ids-701-team-3/blob/main/40-docs/IDS-701_Final_Project_Report.pdf) // [presentation](https://youtu.be/eLjWIdr0psk))

## Machine Learning
* Model-Based Approach to Music Genre Assignment ([github](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-genre-assignment) // [research paper](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/ml-genre-assignment/blob/main/30_docs/final-report.pdf) // [presentation](https://youtu.be/6-7XFk4KC9M)) 
  * Utilized Spotify API to obtain audio data to implement Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning models for improved genre assignment.

## Mobile Application Development
* Mobile Passport ([presentation](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/mobile-passport/blob/main/Mobile%20Passport.pdf))
  * Developed a mobile application that allows visitors of NC state parks to log visits and gain quick access to park information. 

## Duke Data Plus
* Plus Explorations Project ([read more](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/plus-programs-data-exploration/))
  * Improved the Duke Data Plus admissions process by developing a data cleaning pipeline using a Qualtrics API
  * Utilized Machine Learning (Hugging Face) algorithms to perform text analysis on user uploaded files
  * Developed and implemented an all-in-one application for future Plus Program applicants (Data/Code/Climate/CS)

## Algorithmic Trading - Financial Data and Modeling
* Powerful Pairs Trading ([report](https://github.com/rmratliffbrown/rmratliffbrown.github.io/blob/038f33bf9a0e87274aaf348aa47e6ad13e43c96c/files/Final%20Algo%20Paper.pdf))
  * Implemented K-Means Clustering algorithm to select trading pairs across sectors
